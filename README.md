                                             The coffee shop management system project in C is a console-based application that is developed to manage the day-to-day activities of a coffee shop. 
The project is divided into four modules each designed to perform a specific task. The modules are customer management, inventory management, billing, and reporting. The customer management module allows the user to add, edit and delete customer records.
The inventory management module allows the user to add, edit and delete inventory records. The billing module allows the user to generate bills for the customers. The reporting module generates various reports such as customer reports, inventory reports, and bill reports.
